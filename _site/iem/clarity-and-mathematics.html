<p>John Langford has diagnosed a <a href='http://hunch.net/?p=316'>complexity illness</a> that afflicts research in academia. One of its symptoms is what he calls &#8220;Math++&#8221;: the use of unnecessary and obfuscatory mathematics to improve the author&#8217;s chance of publication.</p>

<p>Having recently ploughed through a large number of math-heavy articles during the preparation of a <a href='http://www.learningtheory.org/'>COLT</a> paper I have started to worry whether the illness is contagious. At present there is a rash of awkward notation breaking out in some sections of my draft. While I don&#8217;t think I can completely get rid of it I&#8217;m hoping that I can at least tidy it up and turn it into something presentable.</p>

<p>Wanting to tidy up awkward mathematical expression is definitely not the same as wanting removing it completely. To switch <a href='http://apperceptual.wordpress.com/2007/12/20/readings-in-analogy-making/'>analogies</a>, maths is akin to a communications channel. The aim of the encoder is to cram information down the line so it can be decoded a the other end. Good mathematical notation encodes frequently occurring concepts with short, memorable terms and takes advantage of uses relationships between concepts. Using a side-channel &#8211; e.g., the English text of the paper &#8211; to ease the burden of decoding is also a good strategy.</p>

<p>John also suggests treating Math++ (and other forms of complexity) with education. This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean give a lecture on your research but any attempt at communication. I&#8217;ve found that attempting to describe what I&#8217;m working on over lunch - and without a whiteboard - can be a good way to focus on the story of your research rather than the technicalities. I find technical details of a paper much easier to understand when I understand their motivation.</p>

<p>Even if I don&#8217;t completely cure my paper of Math++, I take some solace from Fernano Pereira who <a href='http://earningmyturns.blogspot.com/2008/02/complexity-illness.html'>points out</a> that research is a form of dialogue and that dialogue is inherently messy which is sometimes the reason mathematical exposition is less than perfect. It&#8217;s only through repeated attempts to communicate ideas that one is able to figure out what is important.</p>
