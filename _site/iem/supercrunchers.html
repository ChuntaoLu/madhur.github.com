  <h1 class="emphnext">Super Crunchers</h1>

<p><a href='http://islandia.law.yale.edu/ayers/indexhome.htm'>Ian Ayers</a> is a surprisingly engaging writer, taking what many would consider a very dry topic &#8211; statistics &#8211; and turning it into a thought-provoking, but flawed, book entitled <a href='http://www.randomhouse.com/bantamdell/supercrunchers/'>Super Crunchers: Why Thinking-By-Numbers is the New Way To Be Smart</a>.</p>

<p>From the opening pages, Ayers pits the &#8220;super crunchers&#8221; &#8211; people applying statistics to large data sets &#8211; against experts in an area, be it viticulture, baseball, or marketing. With barely suppressed glee he describes how number crunching out-predicts the experts time and time again. The point being that as collecting, storing and analysing large amounts of data becomes cheaper and cheaper, more and more decision-making will take the results of &#8220;super crunching&#8221; into account, with experts either having to step aside or learn some statistical chops. To back arguments for the rise of &#8220;super crunching&#8221; Ayers draws on a large number of examples from a variety of areas and even experiments with the technique himself, describing how he used it to help choose the title of his book.</p>

<p>Although I am more or less convinced by Ayers&#8217; arguments I found myself questioning his credibility in several places during the book. I think the main reason for this was due to the tone of the book occasionally crossing the fine line separating &#8220;enthusiastic, popular account&#8221; and &#8220;overly simplistic, gushing rave&#8221;. The constant use of &#8220;super crunching&#8221; throughout the book got on my nerves after a while. It began to overemphasise the newness of what could as easily be called &#8220;statistical analysis&#8221;. After a while I mentally replaced &#8220;super crunching&#8221; with the less sensational &#8220;statistical analysis&#8221; wherever I encountered it.</p>

<p>Conversely, Ayers constantly refers to &#8220;regression&#8221; when talking about the techniques analysts use to make predictions. At first, I thought this was a convenient short-hand for a range of techniques that he didn&#8217;t want to spend time distinguishing between. It was only when neural networks are described as &#8220;a newfangled competitor to the tried-and-true regression formula&#8221; and &#8220;an important contributor to the Super Crunching revolution&#8221; that I realised that Ayers may not know as much about the nuts and bolts of computational statistics as I first thought. This impression was confirmed when Ayers later confuses &#8220;summary statistics&#8221; for &#8220;sufficient statistics&#8221; and talks tautologically of &#8220;binary bytes&#8221;.</p>

<p>Stylistically, there is too much foreshadowing and repetition of topics throughout the book for my liking. This feels a little condescending at times, as does him directly asking the reader to stop and think about a concept or problem at various points.</p>

<p>Overall, I wanted to like this book more than I did. It was a light, enjoyable read and I wholeheartedly agree with Ayers&#8217; belief in the continuing importance of statistics in decision-making and his call to improve the average person&#8217;s intuition of statistics. Unfortunately, I found much of &#8220;Super Crunchers&#8221; substituting enthusiasm for coherence, as well as impressions and anecdote for any kind of meaningful argument.</p>
