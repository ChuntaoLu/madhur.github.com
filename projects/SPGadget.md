Abstract
Can we predict the approach of a regime shift before it happens? Without having observed a transition it may be impossible to identify mechanistic models of the responsible processes. Despite this limitation, we may find certain patterns typical of systems approaching a critical transition that could provide an early warning signal of a shift (Scheffer et al. 2009). This is both an exciting possibility and an immense challenge - even detailed models frequently fail to provide accurate forecasts when extrapolated beyond the range of the data. The highly nonlinear nature of regime shifts and the lack of data outside of the current regime makes this forecasting problem even more challenging. A potential indicator that is too general risks false positives that do not correspond to an approaching transition, while specific indicators may miss more transitions. I was recently able to quantify these probabilities of false alarms and missed detections and investigate the trade-off between these errors for proposed early warning indicators (Boettiger & Hastings 2012). We further introduced a generic model-based indicator that can better minimize both errors at once.

Better indicators and approaches that can synthesize large and diverse data streams may improve such forecasts, but predicting regime shifts will always be an uncertain business. We may at best quantify the probability that a regime shift will occur, a percent chance of a transition. How to we decide what actions to take in face of such valuable but incomplete information? These questions have spurred me to explore questions in optimal control and decision theory, which I am exploring during my post-doctoral work (see Nonparametric-Bayes and Multiple Uncertainty).
