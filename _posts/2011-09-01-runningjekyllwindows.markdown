Jekyll can also be made to run on Windows Operating System. This prefer when I am working on my office laptop which has Windows 7 installed on it.

Following packages are required to setup Jekyll on Windows:

* Ruby & Ruby Development Kit : Can be installed from [here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
* Jekyll
* Python : I used the portable version available [here](http://portablepython.com/wiki/PortablePython3.2.1.1)
* Pygments



**1** Install the Ruby from [http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and install it to path such as C:\ruby

**2** Install the Ruby development kit from [here](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/75127/rubyinstaller-1.9.2-p290.exe) and extract it to path such as c:\devkit.
   Run the following commands 

{% highlight text %}
ruby dk.rb init
{% endhighlight %}
	
   to generate the config.yml file to be used later in this Step
	
**3** Edit the generated config.yml file to include installed Rubies. For example, in our case, it will look like this

{% highlight text %}
# This configuration file contains the absolute path locations of all
# installed Rubies to be enhanced to work with the DevKit. This config
# file is generated by the 'ruby dk.rb init' step and may be modified
# before running the 'ruby dk.rb install' step. To include any installed
# Rubies that were not automagically discovered, simply add a line below
# the triple hyphens with the absolute path to the Ruby root directory.
#
# Example:
#
# ---
# - C:/ruby19trunk
# - C:/ruby192dev
#
---
- C:/ruby

{% endhighlight %}
	
**4** Run the following command to install to DevKit enhance your installed Rubies. This step installs (or updates) an operating_system.rb file into the relevant 
   directory needed to implement a RubyGems
   
   
{% highlight text %}
ruby dk.rb install
{% endhighlight %}
	
**5**	Install Jekyll using following command
{% highlight text %}
gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}
	
**6** Now, you can start using Jekyll. If you require code highlighting using pygments as well, follow the additional steps as well.
Install Portable Python from [here](http://portablepython.com/wiki/PortablePython3.2.1.1)

**7** Now we need to install, easy_install. For python versions > 3, this can be installed from [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute)
Download distribute_setup.py and run the following command in python

{% highlight text %}
python distribute_setup.py
{% endhighlight %}

**8** Now to install pygments, simply run this command:

{% highlight text %}
easy_install Pygments	
{% endhighlight %}

**9** Note that if you are using Python > 3 as discussed in this blog,  you are likely to hit the following error when running Pygmentize


{% highlight text %}
Liquid error: Bad file descriptor
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight text %}
TypeError: Can't convert 'bytes' object to str implicitly
{% endhighlight %}

These are known issues and the resolution has been discussed here:
https://github.com/rtomayko/posix-spawn/issues/17

This requires a change in C:\ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\gems\albino-1.3.3\lib\albino.rb file.

I have created the gist of the changes required [here](https://gist.github.com/1185645)
