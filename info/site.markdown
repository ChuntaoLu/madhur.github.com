The Mechanics
-------------

The content of this site begins life as a directory full of text files on my [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) written using the editor [Gedit] in a format called  [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 

I push all of these out to my [GitHub repository](http://github.com/madhur/madhur.github.com/) using the version control system [git](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/).

To update the site, the text files are first transformed into HTML by [Maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/). [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) orchestrates the whole process, adding headers, navigation bars and the like, creating a directory full of static HTML ready to be served.  

Licence
-------
The main [CSS styling](http://skife.org/css/screen.css) is derived from [Mark Reid's styling](http://github.com/mreid/mark.reid.name/tree/master) and shares the same licensing terms, Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License.

If you also use some of my stuff [let me know](mailto:ahuja.madhur@gmail.com) and I'll add you to this list.
