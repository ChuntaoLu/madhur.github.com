Skills
--------
I can work with the front (browser content) and back (server code) end of web development. I started off doing this, using all the standard technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, ASP.NET, and SQL Server. I haven't done much with ASP.NET lately, favouring SharePoint instead. 

I know a good variety of programming languages too. .NET C# is my favourite, I know the guts of Java very well, and I know Javascript pretty well too. As for compiled languages, I know C++, and can read C, but I haven't done much in these.

I've been experimenting with Backtrack Linux in the last few months, using all the security tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, Metaspoilt, Sqlmap, Kismet, Ettercap etc.

I am also fairly proficient in using tools such as WinDbg, gdb, Ollydbg and IDA Pro for reverse engineering and debugging.

I've used Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and 2010 to create a number of websites. 

For operating systems I have experience in both Linux and Windows, Linux being my current operating system. I also have experience developing extensions for Google Chrome and  Mozilla Firefox.

If any have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

Engine behind this Site
-------------
This website is created with Jekyll, a static website generator written in Ruby. The pages are written in Markdown using Gedit. You can have a look at the source code on GitHub. The template system it uses [Liquid](http://github.com/tobi/liquid). (The syntax-highlighting, is generated by [Pygments](http://pygments.org/), coded in Python)
I push all of these out to my [GitHub repository](http://github.com/madhur/madhur.github.com/) using the version control system [git](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/).
