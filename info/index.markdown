Engine behind this Site
-------------

Rather than opting for one of the ever-popular database-driven blog systems, such as wordpress, I'm actually using [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), which is a static site generator coded in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

What that means is that the page you are currently reading really is a .html page, not a server-processed page with URL rewriting enabled. 


The template system it uses [Liquid](http://github.com/tobi/liquid).

(The syntax-highlighting, incidentally, is generated by [Pygments](http://pygments.org/), coded in Python)
I push all of these out to my [GitHub repository](http://github.com/madhur/madhur.github.com/) using the version control system [git](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/).

To update the site, the text files are first transformed into HTML by [Maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/). [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) orchestrates the whole process, adding headers, navigation bars and the like, creating a directory full of static HTML ready to be served.
