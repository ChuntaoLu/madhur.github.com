About Me and This Site
========

At this site I'd like to present you some information on several topics of my interest. These are self written programs and self written texts.

This homepage is result of my learnings throughout. I didnt did any serious web scripting here. Some of u might feel the contents on these pages to be outdated. These pages were composed only using a text editor and pure HTML, there are no Java scripts, Java applets, cookies or any active code of some kind.


You'll see this page at its best when using a screen resolution of 1024 * 768 pixels. It should also work with lower resolutions.. Executable files you can download from these pages are free of any viruses (however I don't take any responsibility for what they may do). If you have any questions, suggestions, wishes or complaints, please feel free to send me an e-mail. However, I hope you have fun on my page.

I designed this site [{% include blogurl.txt %}](/) in early 2010 with the intention of making it the one-stop-shop for all of my personal and professional information.


The Mechanics
-------------

The content of this site begins life as a directory full of text files on my [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) written using the editor [Gedit] in a format called  [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 

I push all of these out to my [GitHub repository](http://github.com/madhur/madhur.github.com/) using the version control system [git](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/).

To update the site, the text files are first transformed into HTML by [Maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/). [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) orchestrates the whole process, adding headers, navigation bars and the like, creating a directory full of static HTML ready to be served.  

Licence
-------
The main [CSS styling](http://skife.org/css/screen.css) is derived from [Mark Reid's styling](http://github.com/mreid/mark.reid.name/tree/master) and shares the same licensing terms, Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License.

If you also use some of my stuff [let me know](mailto:ahuja.madhur@gmail.com) and I'll add you to this list.
