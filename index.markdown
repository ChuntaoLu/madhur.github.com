Welcome
=======

![Pic](/images/pic.jpg) At this site I'd like to present you some information on several topics of my interest. These are self written programs and self written texts.

This website is created with Jekyll, a static website generator written in Ruby. The pages are written in Markdown using Gedit. You can have a look at the source code on [GitHub]. The template system it uses [Liquid](http://github.com/tobi/liquid). (The syntax-highlighting, is generated by [Pygments](http://pygments.org/), coded in Python)
I push all of these out to my [GitHub repository](http://github.com/madhur/madhur.github.com/) using the version control system [git](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/).

I have significant interests in area  of Penetration testing, Vulnerability Assessment, Reverse Engineering, exploiting buffer overflows and sniffing.
 
I can also [code](/code) and have a done a little bit of it during my undergraduate studies and job and continue to do so whenever I get time.
